    "The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provide you with a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided to you contains one SQL table, subscriptions. Within the table, there are 4 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- id - the subscription id\n",
    "- subscription_start - the start date of the subscription\n",
